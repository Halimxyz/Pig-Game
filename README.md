# Dice Game 🎲

A two-player turn-based dice game where players compete to reach 100 points. On their turn, a player rolls the dice and accumulates points — but rolling a 1 resets the round score and passes the turn. Players must decide strategically when to 'hold' and secure their progress.

## 🕹️ How to Play

- Each player takes turns rolling a die.
- On each roll:
  - If the result is **not 1**, it’s added to the player's *current* score.
  - If the result is **1**, the player loses the *current* score and the turn ends.
- The player can choose to **“Hold”** to add the *current* score to their *total* score and pass the turn.
- First player to reach **100 total points** wins.
